Programming is not the only thing that I read about although I mainly write about it very rarely scratching other subjects. You definatelly won't find gluten-free vegan cake recepies here, but there is a solid chance that I can share with you few words about some hardware. I [did it before](https://pawelgrzybek.com/my-web-development-setup/) about two years aago and I feel that it's just about right time to make fome following update. Things changed, things has been replaced but things mainly has been simplified and minimize. I always enjoy to read about developers hardware / software setup so I thought you may like to read about mine.
