Programming is not the only thing that I read about although I mainly write about it very rarely scratching other subjects. You definatelly won't find gluten-free vegan cake recepies here, but there is a solid chance that I can share with you few words about some hardware. I [did it before](https://pawelgrzybek.com/my-web-development-setup/) about two years aago and I feel that it's just about right time to make fome following update. Things changed, some things has been replaced but things mainly has been simplified and minimize. I always enjoy to read about developers hardware / software setup so I thought you may like to read about mine.

## Hardware

Mattias P Johansson, one of my favourite developers that I hightly recommend you to follow on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/mpjme) or [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCO1cgjhGzsSYb1rsB4bFe4Q), made a [whole video](https://youtu.be/hlYiWznhhzw) about minimalism. Let me quote my favourite part...

> Everything that you acquire, carries a little bit or tiny work that you have to do with it.

When I was younger (not much younger, 2 - 3 years ago) I aimed to own things, latest devices, top spec computers, expensive cameras etc. It took me a while to relise that I'm much happier without it. Reducing maintanence cost and time that I had to spend with all those things gave me an extra chunk of time everyday that I can use to do other things like riding my bike, listenning good music or chilling out and do absolutelly nothing. Followed this principle my hardware setup didn't grow at all. Esentially I don't have (and don't want to have) things that I don't need. Let's check what's inside my bag.

### Macbook Pro with Retina display (Early 2015)

This is exactlly the same computer that I had two years ago. It is a top spec MacBook Pro with 13 inchs screen from early 2015 (3.1GHz Dual-core Intel Core i7, 16GB 1866MHz LPDDR3 SDRAM, Intel Iris Graphics 6100 and 128GB PCIe-based Flash Storage). Of course when I saw a new MacBooks with Touch Bar my cursor hovered over buy button on Apple's website for a little while but... I really like my phicisacl Esc button, I don't need more powerful components and definatelly don't want to spend £2500 on something that I don't need (yet). I have an Apple care with extended warranty plan till mid 2018 — before that sexy body on new MacBooks won't convince to leave a small fortune on Tim Cook's pocket.
