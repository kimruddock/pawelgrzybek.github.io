I have never used this website to uncover big part of myself. It's always been techy blog without going through personal side of myself and photos of my cats (ok I did it [once](https://pawelgrzybek.com/image-tag-vs-background-property/)). I'm going to keep it this way but the article that you are on now is an only exception. End of a year and beginning of a new one is fantastic opportunity to summarize my achievements, failures and set up some goals for upcoming year.

This year was very wild for myself. It's been full of really strong incidents like my mother's cancer (she is fine now) that thought me a lot and made me look at life from totally different perspective. Next year is going to be very important for me as well because since the 20th August 2017 I wont see 2 in from of my age anymore. I'm going to be 30 this year! Let me present my professional and personal achievements followed by my 2017 goals.
