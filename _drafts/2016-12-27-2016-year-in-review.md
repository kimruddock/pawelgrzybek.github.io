I have never used this website to uncover big part of myself. It's always been technical blog without going through some personal feelings and photos of my cats (ok I did it [once](https://pawelgrzybek.com/image-tag-vs-background-property/)). I'm going to keep it this way but the article that you are on now is an only exception. End of a year and beginning of a new one is fantastic opportunity to summarize my achievements, failures and set up some goals for upcoming year.

This year was very wild for myself. It's been full of really strong incidents like my mother's cancer (she is fine now) that thought me a lot and made me look at life from totally different perspective. Next year is going to be very important for me as well because since the 20th August 2017 I wont see 2 in from of my age anymore. I'm going to be 30 this year! Let me present my professional and personal achievements followed by my 2017 goals.


## Profesional

Creare is a company that I worked for almost two years. It is been amazing time for me but in the middle of 2016 management of a company changed and it instantly made me go away. It was a time  to find a better place where I can grow with my passion to web. Literally on the same day when I left the company, guys from Engine Creative send me an invitation for a Front End Dev position. It is a company with amazing reputation and it is not an easy task to join the team of the most creative people in middle England. I did it and I'm extremely proud of being part of this great company. I learn a lot, I have lots of inspiration from my coworkers, huge support from directors and I feel that I make an impact (it sounds so hipster). Thanks Engine!

Developer's life doesn't stop at 5PM when I leave an office. It's been the best year for my open source ever! I contributed over 800 times into plethora of open source projects. The most successful of my open source projects is [Siema](https://pawelgrzybek.com/siema/) - simple carousel plugin written in pure JS with no dependencies. I did it totally for fun, but community adopted this few lines of code really well. Thanks open source people!

The website that you are looking grown up insanely. Maybe not grown up in content massively but it gained surpassingly high popularity. With around 80 unique daily visitors last year now I'm talking about 4000 unique visitors every single day. This is what I call personal success! This year I wrote 30 articles and I consider it as a huge success. Thanks for reading guys, this is the thing that makes me keep publishing more and more in 2017.

## Personal

I realized that I have a problem. I totally lost my balance between personal and professional part of my life. Loosing a balance cannot be considered as a life success but understanding it can be a good starting point to do something with it. More about in resolutions.

For a first time in my life I have some savings. I managed to find a reasonable balance between things that I need and I want — this is definitely helpful when you are turning into 30s.

This year I took first decent holiday in years and I understood the importance of time away of my computer. Thanks to my amazing friend Christina who invited me to spend a week with her in small beautifully village in Greece. I need to say that when I came back after holiday my productivity was better than ever before. I'm adding a decent holiday to a list of things that I'm going to do regularly every year. Thanks again Christina :-*

In 2015 I haven't read any non-technical book. Unfortunately I cannot share with you any impressive number of non-technical books that I read in 2016 but it is getting better. It is such a great feeling to read something that doesn't require every single cog in your brain to spin. I admit to do it more often.

## In 2017 I will...

My main focus in 2017 is around finding a healthy balance between my personal and professional life. I admit to enter my 30s in great brain condition and slightly better physical condition.

Speaking about professional myself, 2017 is a year of new things! In 2017 I will learn new programing language just for fun. It may be Elm, it may be a Swift of first steps with C - will see. Another new thing that I'm planing to do is video making. I'm not going to dedicate my whole life in it, but I need to do something more. As a huge fan of photography I'm planing to invest some money in new system of cameras (Sony) and get my hands dirty with video making.

Few years ago I didn't know English at all, but since I met my other half and moved to UK five years ago things changed and my communication skills are getting better. As it's still not perfect I'm ready to accept a big challenge — speak at my first conference ever. I have been invited to one reputable event and accepted it! Crazy! I submitted few talks on other European conferences in 2017. Stay tuned and [follow me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/pawelgrzybek) to find out more later on this year.

I spent with my girlfriend five years and despite better and worst moments we decided to go one step further. This is too personal to share more details about it here. Essentially I grown up :)

I wish you all amazing 2017 guys. See you in the same place, same time in a year :*
