## New Roadmap for Future of Publishing is Underway as W3C and IDPF Officially Combine

[https://www.w3.org/2017/01/pressrelease-idpf-w3c-combination.html.en](https://www.w3.org/2017/01/pressrelease-idpf-w3c-combination.html.en)

This is biggie! W3C responsible for technologies like HTML, CSS, SVG, XML and WCAG combines powers with IDPF that developed the EPUB standard. Future of publishing is much brighter after this announcement. Another great reason to create semantic markup because we may not notice a moment when books and web pages will blur the difference between each other.

It is well explained, beautiful and really comprehensive.

## JavaScript Start-up Performance

Addy Osmani about performance, who else?! Must read for all js devs. As this article clearly presents its not always about file size. V8 is fantastic with doing an performance optimalization for you but it doesn't handle every scenerio. Don't dispatch your responsibilities to engine — care about it yourself. Such a great in depth read.
