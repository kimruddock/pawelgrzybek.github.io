After a long romance with [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) and ultra hackable [Boxy Theme](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Boxy%20Theme) I switched to  Visual Studio Code by Microsoft. I love it! Functionalitywise there is nothing missing. Visually — yyyhhh. Fortunately some time ago VS Code got a set of features that allows us to customize almost every single aspect of a user interface. It opened a tons of opportunities for theme developers to create a beautiful looking color schemes.

But I still loved a Ocean Boxy theme on my Sublime Text more than anything else. I couldn't find anything similar in [Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/) so I decided to build one.

## Hello Bimbo

Modern and minimalistic looking theme with syntax scheme heavily inspired by [Oceanic Next Color Scheme](https://github.com/voronianski/oceanic-next-color-scheme) for Sublime Text. Every single UI element restyled using recently added options appliable to `workbench.colorCustomizations` object.

You can [download it today from official Microsoft Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=pawelgrzybek.bimbo-theme) — totally for free! From developer for developers! Feedback much appreciated. Thanks [Mark](https://twitter.com/marktay10r) for creating a cool icon for me. Enjoy and have a fantastic day.
