## The Book of Shaders

[https://thebookofshaders.com/](https://thebookofshaders.com/)

Are you into computer graphics? Are you into math by any chance? If yes — this is a resource for you. I learned a lot from this book and I can't believe that this amazing resource is available totally for free. Thanks to talented and super clever [Patricio Gonzalez Vivo](https://twitter.com/patriciogv) and [Jen Lowe](http://jenlowe.net/).

> This book is about the revolutionary computational technique, fragment shaders, that is taking digitally generated images to the next level. You can think of it as the equivalent of Gutenberg's press for graphics. Fragment shaders give you total control over the pixels rendered on the screen at a super fast speed. This is why they're used in all sort of cases, from video filters on cellphones to incredible 3D video games.
