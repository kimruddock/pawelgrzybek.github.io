excerpt: Another New Year's Eve is coming — it is a perfect moment to summarize things that went well, list of fails and some future plan for next twelve months.

Once in a while I do an exception and use this blog to write some personal thoughts instead of trying to be a wise geek. Year ago I published ["A look back at 2016"](https://pawelgrzybek.com/a-look-back-at-2016/) and now it is a time to do an annual update. There are plenty of achievements that I would love to brag about and even more goals that I want to commit myself to. 

## Professional

Being a part of a well-established company is a great opportunity to gain a new experience and learn a lot, but I have never suspected that working for an [Engine Creative](https://www.enginecreative.co.uk/) can give me that much. For a first time in my live I build an web app using a [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/), I learned basics of [Laravel](https://laravel.com/), created a VR experience using[A-Frame](https://aframe.io), made an AR thing using [Wikitude](https://www.wikitude.com/) and went through my first steps to become a game developer using [Unity](https://unity3d.com/). I embraced basics of C# and paradigms related with it's ecosystem. Having a previous experience with [React](https://reactjs.org/) gave me a great starting point to build my first cross-browser mobile app with a help of [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/). A lot! Thanks Engine Creative!

My open source contribution exploded in 2017. [Siema](https://pawelgrzybek.com/siema/) — lightweight and simple carousel in pure JavaScript that I released about a year ago just hit [1800 stars on Github](https://github.com/pawelgrzybek/siema)! [Snippet generator](https://pawelgrzybek.com/snippet-generator/) that I initially build just for myself as a tiny day-to-day helper turned up to be well adopted and very likely used by developers. It has been featured by top industry websites and recommended in multiple podcasts and tutorials. With around 15000 downloads my very own [Bimbo Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=pawelgrzybek.bimbo-theme) for Visual Studio Code received an amazing feedback from users with vision impairments! Such a cool feeling to help thousands people in resolving everyday problems by open source.
