## A Unified Styling Language

[https://medium.com/seek-blog/a-unified-styling-language-d0c208de2660](https://medium.com/seek-blog/a-unified-styling-language-d0c208de2660)

I need to admit that for a first time when I saw JSX in React I thought that it is a joke. I really did my best to master famous separation of concerns. Then people started porting CSS into JavaScript — crazy idea I thought. Nowadays my mindset changed and I really love tha idea of real separation od concerns (not separation of technologies that I was practicing for years). [Mark Dalgleish](https://twitter.com/markdalgleish) published a fantastic article about it. I read many of post about this subject but non of them is as wll explained and convincing as this one. It isn't a three minutes read but it is wort every minute spent on it.

Typical SVG exported straight from Adobe Illustrator, Sketch or any other software contains a lot of meta declarations. Should we keep it or should we safely delete bunch of stuff?

[https://www.sitepoint.com/exploring-es2017-decorators-javascript/](https://www.sitepoint.com/exploring-es2017-decorators-javascript/)

The title is very misleading as the spec for ES2017 is finalized and decorators are definitely not part of a new spec but this article is a very good primer to start with decorators. It is a mechanism well known in other programing languages, implemented and very have used in ANgular 2 (thanks to power of TypeScript). It would be very cool to see decorators in the language.
