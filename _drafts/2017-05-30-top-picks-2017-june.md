I need to admit that for a first time when I saw JSX in React I thought that it is a joke. I really did my best to master famous separation of concerns. Then people started porting CSS into JavaScript — crazy idea I thought. Nowadays my mindset changed and I really love tha idea of real separation od concerns (not separation of technologies that I was practicing for years). [Mark Dalgleish](https://twitter.com/markdalgleish) published a fantastic article about it. I read many of post about this subject but non of them is as wll explained and convincing as this one. It isn't a three minutes read but it is wort every minute spent on it.
