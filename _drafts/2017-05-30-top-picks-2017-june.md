## A Unified Styling Language

[https://medium.com/seek-blog/a-unified-styling-language-d0c208de2660](https://medium.com/seek-blog/a-unified-styling-language-d0c208de2660)

I need to admit that for a first time when I saw JSX in React I thought that it is a joke. I really did my best to master famous separation of concerns. Then people started porting CSS into JavaScript — crazy idea I thought. Nowadays my mindset changed and I really love tha idea of real separation od concerns (not separation of technologies that I was practicing for years). [Mark Dalgleish](https://twitter.com/markdalgleish) published a fantastic article about it. I read many of post about this subject but non of them is as wll explained and convincing as this one. It isn't a three minutes read but it is wort every minute spent on it.

## Stuff at the Top of an SVG

[https://medium.com/@pnowelldesign/stuff-at-the-top-of-an-svg-f3ad198eb54e](https://medium.com/@pnowelldesign/stuff-at-the-top-of-an-svg-f3ad198eb54e)

Typical SVG exported straight from Adobe Illustrator, Sketch or any other software contains a lot of meta declarations. Should we keep it or should we safely delete bunch of stuff? [Peter Nowell](https://twitter.com/pnowelldesign) published a great explanation of all declarations and helps us to decide which parts of SVG files we can easily bin.

## Exploring ES2017 Decorators in JavaScript

[https://www.sitepoint.com/exploring-es2017-decorators-javascript/](https://www.sitepoint.com/exploring-es2017-decorators-javascript/)

The title is very misleading as the spec for ES2017 is finalized and decorators are definitely not part of a new spec but this article is a very good primer to start with decorators. It is a mechanism well known in other programing languages, implemented and very have used in ANgular 2 (thanks to power of TypeScript). It would be very cool to see decorators in the language.

## Results of the Ultimate CSS Survey 2017

Annual CSS survey made by SitePoint is always a great source of front-end important insights. The most surprising for me is number of people still supporting IE8 (and even older browsers).

## Webpack 3: Official Release!!

[https://medium.com/webpack/webpack-3-official-release-15fd2dd8f07b](https://medium.com/webpack/webpack-3-official-release-15fd2dd8f07b)

We saw a big release of webpack 2 just few months — perfect timing to release another major release. Webpack 3 just landed with few highly requested features like: scope hoisting and "magic comments". Maintainers of this popular module bundler confirm that for 98% of users the migration from previous version to current one is smooth without any breaking changes (doesn't apply to plugin creators). Cool cool!
