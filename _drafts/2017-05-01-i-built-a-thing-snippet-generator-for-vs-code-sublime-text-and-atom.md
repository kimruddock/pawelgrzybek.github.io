title: I built a thing - snippet generator for VS Code, Sublime Text and Atom
excerpt: Snippets — probably the most powerful feature of code editors. I love to use them but I don't like to manually create them. Let me simplify things a little bit.

Snippets — one of the most powerful features of my code editor. I use these reusable chunks of code constantly. Over the years I built a huge collection of snippets for Sublime Text. Then I used Atom for a little while and eventually ended up using Visual Studio Code. All of those tools allow us to boost productivity by using custom snippets — if you don't use them yet I highly recommend to embrace it's power. There is one thing thats really sucks about snippets though — creating them. I found it especially painful in VS Code that splits each line into a separated string. I decided to simplify it a little bit…

[Snippets generator](https://pawelgrzybek.com/snippet-generator/) is a tiny React app that makes it much easier and more user friendly. The source code for the app is available [on Github](https://github.com/pawelgrzybek/snippet-generator). Don't judge me — I'm not React expert but its been a fun to build something with it. If you have some ideas for improvements, suggestions or bugs to report, use a Github issues please. Enjoy :-)
