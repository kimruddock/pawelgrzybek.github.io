## Convert String to DOM Nodes

[https://davidwalsh.name/convert-html-stings-dom-nodes](https://davidwalsh.name/convert-html-stings-dom-nodes)

Dawid Walsh explains how to convert strings to DOM nodes by using `parseFromString()` method from [DOMParser](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/DOMParser) instance. Nice, clean and library free solution.

## Comparing the Performance between Native iOS (Swift) and React-Native

[https://medium.com/the-react-native-log/comparing-the-performance-between-native-ios-swift-and-react-native-7b5490d363e2](https://medium.com/the-react-native-log/comparing-the-performance-between-native-ios-swift-and-react-native-7b5490d363e2)

John A. Calderaio build the same iOS app using Swift and React Native. Great idea for comparison of two very opinionated ways of building an iPhone applications. Results are kind of shocking for me where Facebooks framework performs better on two of four tested areas. Really nice read and another great reason to see a bright future for frameworks like React Native.

## JavaScript Deep Merge

[https://davidwalsh.name/javascript-deep-merge](https://davidwalsh.name/javascript-deep-merge)

ECMAScript 2015 brought us `Object.assign()` that allow us to merge two object in nice elegant way. Even newer feature that is coming to JavaScript spec is object spread operator that allows us to do it in even more redeable way (`{...obj1, ...obj2}`). Both of these methods come with one downside — they generate shallow merge or only top properties. In majority of cases it is all that we need but if we need some more reliable way to construct deeply merged objects from multi-level collections [deepmerge](https://www.npmjs.com/package/deepmerge) is a great utility. Thanks [David Walsh](https://davidwalsh.name/javascript-deep-merge) for a great hint.

Rachel Andrew expresses her happiness about CSS Grid Module landing in stable version of Firefox. No doubt — it is a game changer for all of us who build a web experiences on daily basis. Personally I'm ultra excited about using it on my client's projects. If you are still not aware what I'm talking about check the [basic tutorial](https://pawelgrzybek.com/lets-get-into-the-basics-of-css-grid-layout-model/) that I published some time ago or just folow Rachel who does an amazing job on explaining it on her talks and [website dadicated for it](https://thecssworkshop.com/).
