## Convert String to DOM Nodes

[https://davidwalsh.name/convert-html-stings-dom-nodes](https://davidwalsh.name/convert-html-stings-dom-nodes)

Dawid Walsh explains how to convert strings to DOM nodes by using `parseFromString()` method from [DOMParser](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/DOMParser) instance. Nice, clean and library free solution.

## Comparing the Performance between Native iOS (Swift) and React-Native

[https://medium.com/the-react-native-log/comparing-the-performance-between-native-ios-swift-and-react-native-7b5490d363e2](https://medium.com/the-react-native-log/comparing-the-performance-between-native-ios-swift-and-react-native-7b5490d363e2)

John A. Calderaio build the same iOS app using Swift and React Native. Great idea for comparison of two very opinionated ways of building an iPhone applications. Results are kind of shocking for me where Facebooks framework performs better on two of four tested areas. Really nice read and another great reason to see a bright future for frameworks like React Native.

## Testing Your Frontend Code: Part II (Unit Testing)

[https://hackernoon.com/testing-your-frontend-code-part-ii-unit-testing-1d05f8d50859](https://hackernoon.com/testing-your-frontend-code-part-ii-unit-testing-1d05f8d50859)

[Month ago](https://pawelgrzybek.com/top-picks-2017-february/) I linked a first post from the series about testing front-end code by [https://twitter.com/giltayar](Gil Tayar). This month it is time to list remaining parts from this great three-parts tutorial. This time- unit testing with Mocha.

## JavaScript Deep Merge

[https://davidwalsh.name/javascript-deep-merge](https://davidwalsh.name/javascript-deep-merge)

ECMAScript 2015 brought us `Object.assign()` that allow us to merge two object in nice elegant way. Even newer feature that is coming to JavaScript spec is object spread operator that allows us to do it in even more redeable way (`{...obj1, ...obj2}`). Both of these methods come with one downside — they generate shallow merge or only top properties. In majority of cases it is all that we need but if we need some more reliable way to construct deeply merged objects from multi-level collections [deepmerge](https://www.npmjs.com/package/deepmerge) is a great utility. Thanks [David Walsh](https://davidwalsh.name/javascript-deep-merge) for a great hint.

## Grid

[https://tympanus.net/codrops/css_reference/grid/](https://tympanus.net/codrops/css_reference/grid/)


Firefox in version 52 and Google Chrome 57 brought a bunch of great features to stable versions of the most popular browsers. The most important one for me is the CSS Grids Module that I'm very excited about. If you don't have a clue what I am talking about have a look at my [basic introduction](https://pawelgrzybek.com/lets-get-into-the-basics-of-css-grid-layout-model/) that I published some time ago. It is definitely going to change the way how create layouts. Internet is full of great resources to learn it and we are going to see more and more of it soon. This one by codrops is a really comprehensive tutorial with illustrated examples. Another one worth to mention is [http://gridbyexample.com/](http://gridbyexample.com/) created by Rachel Andrew — can't think of a better person who could create a tutorial about this subject. You better catch up guys, you are going to see more and more of "gridy" CSS lines soon.

## World Wide Web, Not Wealthy Western Web
[https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2017/03/world-wide-web-not-wealthy-western-web-part-1/](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2017/03/world-wide-web-not-wealthy-western-web-part-1/)

Probably my favorite article of a month. Bruce Lawson shares tons of insights about difference between internet usage around the glob, born of a world wide web on land of Asia and possible solutions to reach this audience.

> Horatio, as every schoolchild knows, is a designer from Berlin (or sometimes London or Silicon Valley) who has a top-of-the-line MacBook, the latest iPhone and an unlimited data plan over the fastest, most reliable network. But, as Hamlet points out to him, this is not the experience of most of the world’s web visitors.

> Please, do your part to ensure the health of the web that has provided you with so much, and pay it forward so the next people can benefit.

## Dr. Axel Rauschmayer - ECMAScript 2017 and beyond

[https://youtu.be/5Kw4XVSb4P4](https://youtu.be/5Kw4XVSb4P4)

Can't think of a better person that should introduce a set of new ECMAScript 2017 features than Dr. Axel Rauschmayer. Very well explained recently added parts of a spec proceeded by brief summary of spec and organizations behind it.

## Introducing Create React Native App
[https://facebook.github.io/react-native/blog/2017/03/13/introducing-create-react-native-app.html](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/blog/2017/03/13/introducing-create-react-native-app.html)

ReactConf is a place where a lot happens every year. This year has not been different. I highly suggest to browse all the talks as they are all available on React's youtube channel. If I had to pick one thing that I'm the most excited about I would go with `create-react-native-app`. It allows us to setup React Native project in seconds without complicated Xcode or Android studio setup. Thanks to Expo integration. Definitely read it and give it a try. You will be surprised how easy it is nowadays.

## Sketch — A Playground for React Native

[https://blog.expo.io/sketch-a-playground-for-react-native-16b2401f44a2](https://blog.expo.io/sketch-a-playground-for-react-native-16b2401f44a2)

As I [recently mentioned](https://pawelgrzybek.com/my-setup-2017-february/) — I love [Codepen](http://codepen.io/). It allows me to test all my ideas instantly without boring setup. Something like that for mobile apps would be amazing, wouldn't be? Good news is coming — Expo (yes, the same on that comes budneld with `create-react-native-app`) just released Sketch. Is is amazing! Can you believe it? Drag and drop code editor to create a multi-platform mobile applications. CRAZY! Thanks Exo team for doing amazing job!

## React VR

[https://facebookincubator.github.io/react-vr/](https://facebookincubator.github.io/react-vr/)

Yes it os official. It is everywhere now — VR. Facebook just released React version just to build virtual-relity experiences in blink of an eye. It is crazy what happened this month for React community. As a big A-Frame fan I'm tempted to try new product by Mark's Zuckenberg's team now as I'm massive React lover. Can;t wait to see some applications in the wild that are using React VR (I'm sure there will be plenty of them).
