The Observer Pattern is a popular pattern used across all sort of JavaScript applications. The instance (subject) maintains a collection of objects (observers) and notifies them all when change to the state occurs. Does it sound difficult to you? Yes, it was upsetting to me as well when I came across this pattern for a first time. A tiny practical example may help you to grasp it.

Imagine that you have to update multiple elements simultaneously when some event occurs (typing inside the `input` field perhaps). You need to be able to add more (subscribe) elements that react (observe) to a change of an input value. Removing subscription (unsubscribe) can be handy if you no longer need to brodcast state changes to a particular object. Do you get the idea now? Let's code it!

```js
// define a class
class Observer {
  // each instance of the Observer class
  // starts with an empty array of things (observers)
  // that react for a state change
  constructor() {
    this.observers = [];
  }

  // add ability to subscribe to a new object / DOM element
  // esentially, add soemthing to observers array
  subscribe(f) {
    this.observers.push(f);
  }

  // add ability to unsubscribe from particular object
  // esentially, remove soemthing from observers array
  unsubscribe(f) {
    this.observers = this.observers.filter(subscriber => subscriber !== f);
  }

  // update all subscribed objects / DOM elements
  // and pass some data to each of them
  notify(data) {
    this.observers.forEach(subscriber => subscriber(data));
  }
}
```

The usecase example goes like thisâ€¦

```js
// some DOM references
const input = document.querySelector('.js-input');
const p1 = document.querySelector('.js-p1');
const p2 = document.querySelector('.js-p2');
const p3 = document.querySelector('.js-p3');

// some actions to add to observers array
const updateP1 = text => p1.textContent = text;
const updateP2 = text => p2.textContent = text;
const updateP3 = text => p3.textContent = text;

// instantiate new Observer class
const headingsObserver = new Observer();

// subscribe to some observers
headingsObserver.subscribe(updateP1);
headingsObserver.subscribe(updateP2);
headingsObserver.subscribe(updateP3);
```

With tiny little help of few control buttons (added to make the demo more interactive), it gives you the power to do this kind of cool things with just a few lines of code. Isn't it nice?

This very simplified version of the observer pattern can save you from downloading some costy frameworks like Vue of React. If you are looking for detailed explanation of it, I can't recommend enough a ["Learning JavaScript Design Patterns"](https://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/#observerpatternjavascript) by Addy Osmani. Classic! Sometimes "Publication / Subscription" is used interchangeably to describe this pattern, although [there are some minor differences](https://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/#observerpatternjavascript) between them and Addy points them all in his book. Hopefully I this article helped you out. Until next time curious people :-)
