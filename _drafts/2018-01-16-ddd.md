title: You may not need MAMP — setup Apache server, PHP and MySQL in no time
excerpt: MAMP is a fantastic tool to set up a local development environment, but for simple Wordpress project it may be an overkill. Mac OS High Sierra is almost ready to get you cover out of the box.

[MAMP](https://www.mamp.info/) is a fantastic tool that let's you set up a local Apache / Nginx server via single click. I used it for years until I realized that most of the stuff that I need come built-in to the mac OS High Sierra. If it is a quick PHP experiment, Wordpress website or simple Laravel project it is probably more than enough — if you are building something more ambitious I would suggest looking at the things like [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) or [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/).

So what do we need? Apache server, PHP and MySQL database. Apache (available under the name `httpd`) and PHP is already on your mac — to confirm that type `httpd -v && php -v` in command line.

As you can see we almost have all what we need. The only missing things are some tiny configuration adjustments for `httpd` deamon (it is just a fancy name for a background process) and MySQL database. Let's sort it out step by step.

## Start / stop / restart Apache server and change it's document root

I told you that your computer come with Apache server built-in. Can't believe? Open a Terminal and type `sudo apachectl start` followed by your password and navigate your browser to [http://localhost/](http://localhost/).

Boom! It works! The `apachectl` is designed to help us to manage Apache `httpd` daemon. Although it comes with few more methods, the only ones that you need are `start`, `stop` and `restart`. Since it runs on a reserved port (`:80`) that is considered a sensitive system level port, you must run `apachectl` preceded by `sudo`.

The `httpd.conf` file located under the `/etc/apache2/` contains tons of settings for an Apache server, including the location of a confirmation page that says "It works!". We are just about to edit its path and few other things in this file.

Let's setup the path to something more meaningful — `~/Sites/` sounds like a sane common place to locate your web projects. In a command line, type `sudo nano /etc/apache2/httpd.conf` followed by your password to open an Apache configuration file in built-in text editor `nano`.

1. Change `DocumentRoot` to `Sites` directory.
2. Enable PHP.
3. Enable `rewrite_module` to nicely handle `.htaccess` files.

The only missing link is a MySQL database — you can solve it by downloading and installing a [MySQL Community Server DMG archive](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/) from official website. Installation is straight-forward but please pay attention the the very last step — take a note or make a screen grab because we will need this password later on.
