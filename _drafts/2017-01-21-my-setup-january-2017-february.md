Programming is not the only thing that I read about although I mainly write about it very rarely scratching other subjects. You definatelly won't find gluten-free vegan cake recepies here, but there is a solid chance that I can share with you few words about some hardware. I [did it before](https://pawelgrzybek.com/my-web-development-setup/) about two years aago and I feel that it's just about right time to make fome following update. Things changed, some things has been replaced but overall everything has been simplified and minimized. I always enjoy to read about developers hardware / software setup so I thought you may like to read about mine.

## Hardware

Mattias P Johansson, one of my favourite developers that I hightly recommend you to follow on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/mpjme) or [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCO1cgjhGzsSYb1rsB4bFe4Q), made a [whole video](https://youtu.be/hlYiWznhhzw) about minimalism. Let me quote my favourite part...

> Everything that you acquire, carries a little bit or tiny work that you have to do with it.

When I was younger (not much younger, 2 - 3 years ago) I aimed to own things, latest devices, top spec computers, expensive cameras etc. It took me a while to relise that I'm much happier without it. Reducing maintanence cost and time that I had to spend with all those things gave me an extra chunk of time everyday that I can use to do other things like riding my bike, listenning good music or chilling out. Followed this principle my hardware setup didn't grow at all. Esentially I don't have (and don't want to have) things that I don't need. Let's check what's inside my bag.

### Macbook Pro with Retina display (Early 2015)

This is exactlly the same computer that I had two years ago. It is a top spec MacBook Pro with 13 inchs screen from early 2015 (3.1GHz Dual-core Intel Core i7, 16GB 1866MHz LPDDR3 SDRAM, Intel Iris Graphics 6100 and 128GB PCIe-based Flash Storage). Of course when I saw a new MacBooks with Touch Bar cursor or my mouse hovered over the buy button on Apple's website for a little while but... I really like my phicisacl Esc button, I don't need more powerful components and definatelly don't want to spend £2500 on something that I don't need (yet). I have an Apple care with extended warranty plan till mid 2018 — before that time sexy body on new MacBooks won't convince me to throw a small fortune on Tim Cook's pocket.

### iPhone 7 Plus 16GB

I bought my first iPhone in 2010. Since that I didn't use devices from different manufacture because this one just works. No suppresises here — 16GB version of iPhone 7 Plus resides in my pocket. It is extremally stable, comfortable to use and it has one thing that makes me love this device — camera! Camera is just amazing and in majority of cases it is more powerful than I need on my daily basis. There's no rose without a thorn though. I'm getting jelous about access to realy cool features that users of latest Andoid smartphones have. [The (Not So) Secret Powers Of The Mobile Browser](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/12/the-not-so-secret-powers-of-the-mobile-browser/) by [Stéphanie Walter](https://twitter.com/WalterStephanie/) is a great article on Smashing Magazine that walks us through cool modern features of mobile browsers. Cool, but the fact that I'm ultra excited about it doesn't mean that I can try any of them so... Apple, please! Catch up! We (developers) need Service Workers, we want to make progressive web apps, we wish to play around with payment or bluetooth interface as Andoiders do. I won't use Android device from convenience reasons only but I may buy one of thos fancy Pixels XL to mess around with VR and other cool stuff that Stéphanie wrote about.

### Bose QC35

This year another cool gadget joined a list of things that I'm not going out without in my bag. Bose QuietComfort 35 wireless headphones is probably the best spent £329 in my whole life. When I'm coding or writing the importance of isolation from outside world and being alone with my own thoughts is imensily important. Fact of wireless connectivity was difficult to jump through as I doubted quality of non-phisical solutions in quality music territory. Things changed aparently and I won't go back to cable - no chance. This headphones have some accosional bluetoothe connectivity issues and battery doesn't last forever but overall I'm extremally happpy and I can't imagine a single day of productive work without it.
