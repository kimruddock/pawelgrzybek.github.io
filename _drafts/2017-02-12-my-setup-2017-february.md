Programming is not the only thing that I read about although I mainly write about it and very rarely scratching other subjects. You definatelly won't find gluten-free vegan cake recepies here, but there is a solid chance that I can share with you a few words about some hardware. I [did it before](https://pawelgrzybek.com/my-web-development-setup/) about two years ago and I think that is just about right time to make some following update. Things changed, some things has been replaced but generally everything has been simplified and minimized. I always enjoy to read about developers hardware / software setup so I thought you may like to read about mine.

## Hardware

Mattias P Johansson, one of my favourite developers that I hightly recommend you to follow on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/mpjme) and [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCO1cgjhGzsSYb1rsB4bFe4Q), made a [whole video](https://youtu.be/hlYiWznhhzw) about minimalism. Let me quote my favourite part…

> Everything that you acquire, carries a little bit or tiny work that you have to do with it.

Few years ago I aimed to own things, latest devices, top spec computers, expensive cameras etc. It took me a while to relise that I'm much happier without it. Reducing maintanence cost and time that I had to spend with all those things gave me an extra bit of time that I can use to do other things like riding my bike, listening good music or hanging out with my friends. Followed this principle my hardware setup didn't grow at all. Esentially I don't have (and don't want to have) things that I don't need. Let's check what's inside my bag.

### Macbook Pro with Retina display (Early 2015)

It is a top spec MacBook Pro with 13 inchs screen from early 2015 (3.1GHz Dual-core Intel Core i7, 16GB 1866MHz LPDDR3 SDRAM, Intel Iris Graphics 6100 and 128GB PCIe-based Flash Storage). Of course when I saw a new MacBooks with Touch Bar cursor or my mouse hovered over the buy button on Apple's website for a little while but... I really like my phicisacl Esc button, I don't need more powerful components and definatelly don't want to spend £2500 on something that I don't need (yet). I have an Apple care with extended warranty plan till mid 2018 — earlier than that sexy body on new MacBooks won't convince me to throw a small fortune on Tim Cook's pocket.

### iPhone 7 Plus 16GB

I bought my first iPhone in 2010. Since then I haven't used devices from different manufactures because this one just works. No suppresises here — 32GB version of iPhone 7 Plus resides in my pocket. It is extremally stable, comfortable to use and it has one thing that makes me love this device — camera! Sometimes it is just hard to believe that something that small can produce that insanely good quality picture. There's no rose without a thorn though. I'm getting jelous about access to realy cool features that users of latest Andoid smartphones have. [The (Not So) Secret Powers Of The Mobile Browser](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/12/the-not-so-secret-powers-of-the-mobile-browser/) by [Stéphanie Walter](https://twitter.com/WalterStephanie/) is a great article on Smashing Magazine that walks us through cool modern features of mobile browsers. Cool, but the fact that I'm ultra excited about it doesn't mean that I can try any of them so… Apple, please! Catch up! We (developers) need Service Workers, we want to make progressive web apps, we wish to play around with payment or bluetooth interface as Googlers do. I won't use Android device from convenience reasons only but I may buy one of those fancy Pixels XL to mess around with VR and other cool stuff that Stéphanie wrote about. Apple, please…

### Bose QC35

This year another cool gadget joined a list of things that I'm not going out without in my bag. Bose QuietComfort 35 wireless headphones is probably the best spent £329 in my whole life. When I'm coding or writing the importance of isolation from outside world and being alone with my own thoughts is immensely important. I doubted sound quality of wireless, non-phisical soultions before I got them. Things changed aparently and I won't go back to cable — no chance. It has some occosional bluetoothe connectivity quirks and battery doesn't last forever but overall I'm very happpy and I can't imagine a single day of productive work without it. Lightweight construction, quality build and sound quality is something that I expected from this price range of product and I don't feel disapointed at all. Wanna test before placing an order? Grab a beer and pop in my friend.

## Software

Following the same principle as with the hardware, I use much less software on my devices. Compared to [the same list](https://pawelgrzybek.com/my-web-development-setup/) that I made few years ago, some little toys has been replaced with more holistic productivity solutions, some stayed as they were and lots of stuff just disapeared. Lets dig into my geeky toolkit.

### Google Chrome

There must be a reson why this app keeps it's status of the most popular web browser for many years. No supprises here — Google Chrome is probably the most frequently used app on my computer. Despite the seamless bookmarks, plugins and setting syncronization, this browser has one big advantage compared to it's competitors — dev tools. Number of helpful panels for web developers is the main reason why I use it. Fantastic team of enginers who are working hard to make it better supprise me every time when they release a new version. React Developer Tools, Vue.js devtols, uBlock Origin, Pinboard Tools 1Password and JSON Formatter are the only extensions that I added to it.

### VSCode

As a huge fan of [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/), creator of few plugins and active supporter of this app's developement, switching to a different code editor would be the least expected thing some time ago. In the meantime Microsoft did two tings that front-end developers should know about: [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). Typescript is fantastic, but do you know what is better? Yes, Visual Code Studio! Open-source, written entirely with web technologies like HTML, CSS and JavaScript wrapped into multiplatform desktop app with Electron, lightweight, fast, beautiful and extremally powerful. Compared to ST where learning curve and configuration takes some time to fully embrace it's potential, VSCode gives you the top-notch user experience out of the box. Community loves to use it and improve it — just have a look at any of the monthly updates change log full of new features. Integrated command line saves me so much time on juming back and forth between editor and iTerm. Integrated Git client allows me to commit progress of my work, fetch changes from remote branch or push current state in fraction of a second. Built in IntelliSense makes my life a whole lot easier — methods definitions, parameters info, autocompletion. When an IDE ish look of it distracts me I switch to minimal Zen mode with a single shortcut. I can really write a poem about it but it is no point, just download it, use it and love it as I do. If you are looking for helpful tips with smooth transition from Sublime Text to Microsoft's product, check few of my recent articles about [config files](https://pawelgrzybek.com/sync-vscode-settings-and-snippets-via-dotfiles-on-github/) and [custom tasks](https://pawelgrzybek.com/using-the-javascript-console-in-visual-studio-code/). You can be asured that I'm going to write about it here.

### Sketch & Affinity Photo

I'm not a designer and I don't use graphic aplications as often as I use my code editor. I just need a reliable tool to make a simple logo for my tiny open source projects, quickly smash some prototype to upload it on inVision or crop image of my cat to upload it on a Facebook. Sketch is probably the best UI design tools that I have ever worked with — not a supprise as [2016 Web Design Trend Report](https://avocode.com/design-report-2016/) clearly show that Sketch is not a niche anymore. I love the intuitive workflow, speed, iCloud integration, resizing options that are not available in other tools and of course plugins API that opens an wide area of oportunities. Affinity Photo is my Photoshop replacement — maybe it isn't that powerful, it doesn't have video editing options (why would you need that in PHOTOshop) and maybe there is not that much youtube tutorials as it is about Photoshop but it does the job really well. I published ["I won't miss you Adobe"](https://pawelgrzybek.com/i-wont-miss-you-adobe/) two years ago and nothing really changed since. I have nothing against Adobe package apart from it's price.

### Alfred

As a long term Alfred user I embraced it's power only recently. On a first glance it looks like a default spotlight but when you dig deeper this can be one of the best productivity friends of your life. It's power allowed me to delete so many little apps like [CopyLess](https://copyless.net/) and [Divvy](http://mizage.com/divvy/). Apart from features like custom web search, snippets manager and multi clipboard it does one more thing that gives you endless almost posibilities — [workflows](https://www.alfredapp.com/workflows/). Recently I created a few workflows that got really good adoption in the community: [Div — a simple Alfred window manager](https://pawelgrzybek.com/div-simple-alfred-windows-manager/), [Github Search](http://www.packal.org/workflow/github-search) and handy [npm search](http://www.packal.org/workflow/alfred-npm-search). If you are one of thos who like to automate repetitive tasks, this is a tool for you. The basic version is free of charge but the real power comes with Powerpack that costs three pints of a beer.

### Tweetbot

I'm addicted of Twitter — I literally read every single tweet. Web client is getting better every update, but in my opinion it is not the most convenitnt way of usnign Twitter. Tweetbot by [Tapbots](https://tapbots.com/) is an app that I found very useful by giving me features that I don't have from official app. [Desktop version](https://tapbots.com/tweetbot/mac/) and [iOS one](https://tapbots.com/tweetbot/) is a perfect combination because it comes with a timeline sync —  I never miss a single tweet. Mute filters are great for hiding from my feed football buzz that I dont really care about. Easy shortcut to send items to "read later" app of choice is something that I use a lot. On top of that this app just looks beautiful — much better than official one. Not cheap though — wait for a sale that happens ocasionally and you won;t regret it.

### Reeder

I use this app since it came out. I tested other RSS readers in the meantime but I havent found one that is as good as my favourite [Reeder](http://reederapp.com/) by Silvio Rizzi. It's beautiful, full of useful gestures that makes it feel as one of the core mac OS / iOS apps, fast and reliable. If you are oldschool like myself and still believe in power of RSS give this one a try. In combination with free Feedly account it serves me fresh content everyday.

### 1password

Probably the first piece of software that I install on my devices. It holds all my passwords and private date under one single password or touch or my thumb on iOS. I know that many other passwords managers exists and I havn't tried them because tis one suits my needs perfectly. Google Chrome extension gives me access to all my super complicated passwords straght from window of my browser. It syncs really well between my devices via iCloud. If you are concearned about keeeping encrypted data in the cloud you can always sync it via wi-fi and stay away from remote servers. For many years it keeps a status of a best password manager.

### Things

I'm not a productive ninja but I use some sort of "to do" methodology because I easily forget about stuff. [Things](https://culturedcode.com/) is really cool with it! If perfectly fits into GTD (get things done) metodology workflow, ofers a dedicated cloud sync, looks beautiful on both iPhone and mac OS. Repetetive tasks, projects management and events scheduling is something that differs it from default remminders app.

### ScreenFlow

Do you record screencasts? Do you need some basic video editing app? Animated gif are cool, aren't they? This is app for you. Every single video that I post of Twitter / Facebook, animated gif, screencast, "how to do" video for client I record via [ScreenFlow](http://www.telestream.net/screenflow/). It is not cheap but wort of this money. Very intuitive interface require almost none learning curve, great integration with all possible media formats, tons of shortcuts, configurations options, amazing library of video tutorials and so many more cool things make it the best screencast app ever.

### Mail App

I do receive emails mainly from Ebay, Amazon, PayPal, Discogs and ocasionally from my mom. Default Mail App is everything that I need.

## Web services

Locally installed apps is not the only type of software that I use. Web is powerful enough to work as a great enviorement to handle powerful / usefull web apps. There is plenty of great tools and I use few of them on daily basis. I'm not going to go through obvious things like mail providers or contacts / calendars sync services. Just a specifiic tools for specific use cases.

### Pinboard

Some time ago I published a [whole article](https://pawelgrzybek.com/bookmarking-with-pinboard/) about [Pinboard](https://pinboard.in/) created by Maciej Cegłowski. In my opinion this the best place to bookmark links, opened browser tabs, tweets and article to read later. The design isn't catchy, it costs money and there isn't a first bookmarking service that pops out on Google results but it comes with other values — usability and performance. Great taggig system, handy browser extensions, advanced API that allows other apps to connect with it are my reasons to use it, stay with it and not looking somewhere else.

### Feedly

Yeah I know, RSS is dead, blah, blah, blah... Nope! I love RSS and it is still my main source of web info. Since early days of Google Reader I use this technology and it doesn't slow down. Nowadays I use Feedly to fetch feeds from my favourite websites. To consume them I use mentioned above Reeder. The free version is absolutely enough if you need just an agregator.

### Codepen

This is one of very few web services that I paid money for and I absolutely don't regret it. I use Codepen every single day to smash some quick front-end experiment, to check posibilities of my stupid ideas and for...

### CrossBrowserTesting.com

Cross browser testing! It was always a pain. Without paing for an expensive services like BrowserStack of you are basicly screwed. Good news is coming! As I'm CodePen Pro user I have access to test all my experiments with CrossBrowserTesting.com totally for free. It is amazing, isn't it? It helped me a lot to make a comprehensive tests of one of my recent libraries [Siema](https://pawelgrzybek.com/siema/) and it serves me well every single day. Works like a charm, it is quick and gives me an access to hundreds of browsers across many operating syatems. Love it!

### Apple Music

On the other side of a room I have about half of a thousen vinyl records categorised in few categories: polish jazz, polish rap, jazz, rap, funk, compilations, singles, 45s. I love music and I love it not olny at home, but I love it when I work, when I run or when I cook. Apple Music is my service of choice. I don't want to go in depth why I choose this one not another one. I tried it, it works great, it doesn't cost fortune and doesn't require additinal software apart from this one that already resides on my mac.

Of course thats not everything that I use...

It turned up to be much longer than I initialy expected. Sorry I you feel bored by now. If you published an article or video about your setup, please send me a link. I'm sure I will do it again at some point.

Until next time, stay safe :-*
