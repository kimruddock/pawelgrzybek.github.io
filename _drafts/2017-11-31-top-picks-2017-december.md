Webpack is amazing but the only downside of it may be a configuration that can be overwhelming. Parcel comes handy then. This is a new kid on the block — no configuration is required and somehow it resolves all dependencies for you. Fingers crossed for future of this project.

NPM client five time faster than it's origin, smaller node_modules size and most interestingly works in the browser — Turbo. Another bran new tool that the Twitter went crazy about. Instant dependency resolution, robust caching mechanisms and works great with tiny and massive apps. Sounds nice, time will show us if it is going to take over the popularity of good old npm and yarn.

Google changes indexing mechanism fro desktop-first to mobile-first. We should expect a strong indexing bump for all websites that are mobile optimized and probably a significant drop for old-school, not maintained projects.
