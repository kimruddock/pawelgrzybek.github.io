## TypeScript: the missing introduction

[https://toddmotto.com/typescript-the-missing-introduction#background](https://toddmotto.com/typescript-the-missing-introduction#background)

One of my colleagues recommended me TypeScript the other day as a thing that I necessarily need to have a look at — future of JS. I was stubborn for quite a while until I came across this great primer to TypeScript by [James Henry](https://twitter.com/MrJamesHenry). It just makes sense! JavaScript is first (and the only one) programming language that I know and I didn't really understand concept of types from other languages. I even learned a lot about coercion and explicitly used in my applications. This article made my life a bit easier and I commit myself to dig deeper into TS.

[Tyler Gaw](https://twitter.com/tylergaw) built a great tool that is insanely helpful to understand CSS color functions! ColorMe allow you to preview code generated by applying new filter to base colors. It is a React app built on top of Create React App. More about building process on Tyler's blog post. Thanks for creating it mate!
