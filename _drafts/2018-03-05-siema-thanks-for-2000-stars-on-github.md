In November 2016 I was looking for a carousel for one of my projects. I found about hundreds of them but none of them fulfilled my requirements: simple API, extendable, lightweight and optimized for performance. I spent enough of time on my research just to decide to build my own solution on the end. It worked surprisingly well for me so I decided to smash it on to the [Github repository](https://github.com/pawelgrzybek/siema), build a simple [docs page](https://pawelgrzybek.com/siema/) and ask my talented friend [Jarkko Sibenberg](http://www.sibenberg.com/) to create a logo for the project. Months passed, hours on the project spent and 280 commits later‚Ä¶

Siema's stars counter on GitHub just hit 2000 stars. With thousands of downloads (from [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) only) every week, hundreds of projects (from Github only) depend on it. It has been featured on the most reputable web related services around like: Smashing Magazine, WDRL, Net magazine, Codrops and many more. Thanks!

## The future of Siema

Few weeks back I dropped [Siema 1.5](https://github.com/pawelgrzybek/siema/releases/tag/v1.5.0) with list of the most frequently requested features. The overall feedback was amazing and I am really happy that people received the options that they were waiting for. I am not going to add more features anytime soon but it doesn't mean that the project is finished. I can reveal few plans for the future version 2.0. There you go:

- full API coverage
- flexbox (it will affect browser support)
- TypeScript everything
- E2E testing
- new documentation
- centered mode
- modifying multiple items via `remove`, `insert`, `prepend` and `append` method
- accessibility improvements
- performance optimization
- addons (pagination, navigation as an optional packages)

## Thank y'all

I would like to thank you all for using Siema, reporting bugs, sending pull requests and supporting development in any way. Every one of you who ever wondered if it is a good idea to build an open source project ‚Äî do it! It is hard work and costs lots of time and energy but it is irreplaceable lesson and opens tons of great opportunities.
