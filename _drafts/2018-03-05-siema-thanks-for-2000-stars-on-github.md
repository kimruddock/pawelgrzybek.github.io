It was November 2016, I was looking for a carousel for one of my projects. I found about hundreds of them but none of them fulfilled my requirements: simple API, lightweight and optimized for performance. I spent enough of time on my research just to decide to build my own solution on the end. It worked surprisingly well for me so I decided to smash it on the [Github repository](https://github.com/pawelgrzybek/siema), build a simple [docs page](https://pawelgrzybek.com/siema/) and ask my talented friend [Jarkko Sibenberg](http://www.sibenberg.com/) to create a logo for the project.
